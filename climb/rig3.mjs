// rig3 — the instrument, fixed.
//
// This is a parity-checked copy of sim/climb_lib.mjs's attempt()/replay()
// (that file's lines 99-152). sim/ is off-limits to edit and importing it runs
// its top level (a second MjModel + a second ONNX session), so this is a COPY.
// Every line of the episode staging below — cfg, spawn, the 25-tick settle, the
// +0.8 s track tail, the 50-tick hold, the ctrl blend, the clamp — is
// reproduced verbatim from climb_lib. Phase P below PROVES that: same track,
// same opts, same rise, through both harnesses, compared at full float digits
// (climb/audit_cross.mjs's method).
//
// What is DIFFERENT, and why:
//
//  (1) A LATERAL GATE. climb_lib's criterion (line 150) has no y term at all,
//      and neither does its feetUp loop (line 144: z and x only). The flight is
//      only 340 mm wide (site/stairs.js STAIR_HALF_WIDTH = 0.17), so a duck
//      that walks 426 mm off the side of it and stands on the floor scores
//      "trunk past the riser" — the podium confound at flight scale. Here
//      |y - STAIR_Y| <= 0.17 gates the criterion, the feetUp test, AND the
//      exported reward.
//
//  (2) THE FOOT-x BUG. climb_lib line 144 accepts a foot as "at/above the
//      tread" when x > 0.05. The first riser is at x = 0.12. A foot at
//      x = 0.06, z = h is 60 mm IN FRONT of the riser face, in mid-air, and it
//      counts. feetOnTread here requires x > 0.12 — the same line the trunk
//      has to cross.
//
//  (3) SCORING READS A FILE. scoreSaved() takes a PATH and JSON.parse()s it.
//      There is no entry point that scores an in-memory candidate, because the
//      exported keyframes are rounded (search_0.mjs:300 pose->4 dp, blend/gap/
//      side->4 dp; search_2.mjs:307 pose->5 dp) while the numbers quoted in the
//      notes came from the unrounded candidate. Phase R measures how far apart
//      those two are.
//
//  (4) THREE TAILS. climb_lib scores 50 ticks of BEST_alpha_stand.onnx AFTER
//      the track ends. Terminal trunk z is 115.3-118.1 mm in 41 of 41 upright
//      replays and a do-nothing control lands in the same band, which is what
//      you would expect if that tail simply walks the duck back to a floor
//      stance. --tail selects:
//        policy : 50 ticks of the stand policy   (climb_lib's own tail)
//        hold   : 50 ticks with data.ctrl frozen at clamp(final track pose),
//                 no ONNX call at all — the servos hold position
//        none   : score at the track's last tick; then run the 50 hold ticks
//                 anyway and report whether it is still upright after them
//      'none' and 'hold' are the same simulation (they differ only in which
//      snapshot is the answer), so one run yields both.
//
//  (4b) ROUND 5, THE SERVOED LANDING. An optional `servo` field (see
//      climb/servo.mjs) that, once armed by an authored track time or by the
//      round-4 event, takes the ten LEG slots off the keyframe track and
//      commands them EVERY CONTROL TICK from measured trunk height above the
//      tread, trunk pitch, trunk x relative to the riser line, and each foot's
//      x and z relative to the tread edge and top. Head and neck keep
//      following the keyframes. Targets are rate-limited and clamped to
//      [LO, HI]; the actuator ceiling is untouched. A file with no `servo`
//      replays byte-identically — climb/_r5_parity.mjs proves that on 318 rows
//      against climb/rig3_pre_r5.mjs (a byte copy of this file at commit
//      e00e1e4) and reproduces the round-4 judge's own PHASE P counts against
//      climb/rig3_pre_r4.mjs.
//
//  (4c) ROUND 5, THE WHOLE-EPISODE PENETRATION FIELD. penetrationAtScore is
//      one instant, so a move that passes THROUGH a block on the way up and
//      arrives clean scored clean (round 3 measured -9.4 mm transiently).
//      `minPenetrationEpisode` is the most negative mj_geomDistance between
//      any duck geom and any step geom at ANY control tick of the episode —
//      settle, track and tail — with the pair and the tick named. Exact, not
//      sampled: the bounding-sphere skip is a lower bound on the distance.
//
//  (5) A SPAWN OVERRIDE. An intent JSON may carry `spawn: {x,y,z}`, which
//      replaces the gap/side spawn. That is the only way to author the row a
//      criterion MUST pass: a duck already standing on the first tread.
//
// Contact detection is mj_geomDistance, never data.contact.get(i) — that
// returns an embind object that leaks the WASM heap to 2 GB in ~20 s even when
// .delete() is called (see climb/rig2.mjs).
//

// THE EPISODE LOOP IS NO LONGER IN THIS FILE. Everything from the cfg and the
// spawn down to the fiftieth tail tick — the settle, the +0.8 s track tail, the
// ctrl blend, the clamp, the event, the servo, the penetration tracker, the
// criterion and the shaped reward — now lives ONCE, in sim/climb_score.mjs, and
// robust.mjs and the bench's /climb import the same function. It was three
// copies: this one, robust.mjs's go() (its own header called itself "the ONE
// round-3 copy"), and the fourth the bench was about to grow so a phone could
// score a move. Three copies of a loop whose output is a trajectory do not stay
// equal by being read carefully.
//
// WHAT IS STILL THIS FILE'S IS THE RECORD. climb/audit_r6.mjs PHASE P1 compares

// THE ACCEPTANCE TEST FOR /chase.
//
// WHAT IS BEING CLAIMED. A phone can score a ball entrant. The claim is not
// "the phone runs some physics"; it is that a cell scored through POST /chase
// is THE SAME CELL `chase/chase_robust.mjs` scores — the scorer the bundled
// leaderboard and the published package are decided by — so that "chased 4 of
// 9" means on a phone what it means in the package. A bench that answered a
// different number under the same name would be worse than a bench that
// answered nothing, because the number would be believed.
//
// SO IT IS MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED. Every bundled entrant, every one of the
// fourteen grid cells, scored twice: once through the bench's own `handle`
// (in-process, no socket, which is exactly what the WebView bridge does) and
// once through `chase_robust.scoreChase`. EVERY numeric field is compared with
// `Object.is` at FULL FLOAT DIGITS — the eight facts, the verdict, the tick
// counts, all nine of Pollen's transcribed reward terms, the frozen heading,
// the ball's start and end, and the entrant hash — because a gate that checks
// only the verdict cannot tell a matching verdict from a matching trajectory.
//
// THEN THE FIRST CONTROL IS CHECKED AGAINST THE THING IT EXISTS TO PROVE.
// `ctrl_do_nothing` must score 0 of 14. A criterion that row passes is not a
// chasing test, and that check runs before any of the others are believed.
//
// AND THE AGGREGATES ARE RECOMPUTED FROM THE /chase ANSWERS ALONE and required
// to equal chase_robust's. That is the half a per-cell comparison cannot do:
// two scorers can agree cell by cell and still be counted differently.

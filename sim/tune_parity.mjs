// The two things /tune borrows from another language, checked against it.
//
// WHY A THIRD PARITY SCRIPT. `policy_parity.mjs` asks whether this repo's
// forward pass agrees with onnxruntime, and `physics_parity.mjs` asks whether
// the phone's trajectory is the desk's. Neither of them touches /tune, and
// /tune is the endpoint that took two definitions out of somebody else's
// repository and rewrote them here:
//
//   • WHAT A GAIN AND A TRIM MEAN. duckkit's `DuckPolicyWriter.folding` is the
//     definition — it is the code that will actually write the tuned file the
//     robot loads. `foldParameters` in policyforward.mjs is a transcription of
//     it, and a transcription that is 1e-5 out is a DIFFERENT NETWORK from the
//     one the app ships, so a search would be scoring something nobody will
//     ever run. This compares the canonical bytes, and it compares them as
//     BYTES: `Float(gain)` in Swift rounds the multiplier to binary32 before it
//     multiplies, and JavaScript's obvious spelling does not, which is a
//     different last bit on a gain like 1.07.
//
//   • WHAT EACH REWARD TERM IS. StudioKit's `RunMetrics` reads the six terms
//     out of `microduck_velocity_env_cfg.py` and is what every clip in the app
//     is graded by. `rewardSums` in duckbench-core.mjs is a second reading of
//     the same config, and two readings of one config is exactly how a search
//     comes to climb a hill the rest of the app cannot see — with both numbers
//     looking plausible. So both sides score the SAME fifty ticks and must
//     agree to 1e-9.
//
// THE TICKS COME OUT OF THE ENDPOINT, NOT OUT OF A HARNESS. `/tune` with
// `"trace": true` answers with the first drop's ticks, so the fixture behind
// this gate is a recording of the thing clients call. A fixture produced by a
// private code path would prove that the private path agrees with Swift and say
// nothing about the endpoint.
//
//   node sim/tune_parity.mjs            # check both halves
//   node sim/tune_parity.mjs --emit     # re-record the trace fixture first
//   node sim/tune_parity.mjs --bench 100.122.199.6:8770   # emit from a LIVE bench
//
// THE SWIFT HALF HAS TO HAVE RUN. `base.bin`, `folded.bin` and `fold.json` are
// written by `BenchTuneParityTests` in StudioKit — `swift test` produces them.
// If they are not there this script says so and FAILS rather than reporting a
// pass it did not earn.

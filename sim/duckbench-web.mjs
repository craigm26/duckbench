// The duck bench, in a browser. Same core, a different machine under it.
//
// WHAT THIS ANSWERS. Duck Studio's whole shape rests on one sentence — "an
// iPhone has no physics engine" — and that sentence has been repeated in
// comments, docs and UI copy until it reads like a property of the hardware. It
// is a property of the BUILD. MuJoCo ships a WebAssembly target; the .wasm in
// site/vendor is byte-identical to the one the Pi bench runs (md5 c08b79f7…),
// and WebAssembly's float arithmetic is IEEE-754 with no fast-math, so it is
// the same integrator producing the same numbers. The policy is four matrix
// multiplies over 197,774 floats. Neither of those needs a desk.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT ANSWER, SAID HERE RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER:
//
//   • /upload is refused. It takes ONNX bytes, and this shell has no ONNX
//     parser — deliberately: `policyforward.mjs` reads duckkit's CANONICAL
//     PARAMETER BYTES, which is the layout DuckEvidence already fingerprints a
//     policy by, so the phone runs exactly the numbers the app attested to. A
//     second ONNX reader in JavaScript would be a second opinion about what a
//     policy is. The app can produce canonical bytes for anything it can load,
//     so this is a wiring job and not a wall — but it is not wired, and the
//     endpoint says so instead of failing obscurely.
//
//   • A TRAJECTORY FROM HERE IS NOT THE DESK'S TRAJECTORY. Measured on the Pi
//     over the physics-parity script: identical to 1e-4 for the first fifty
//     ticks, then 2 mm apart at tick 100, 9 mm at 150, 19 mm at 200, 32 mm at
//     250. The physics is the same; the INFERENCE differs by up to 3.5e-6 per
//     action between onnxruntime and policyforward (policy_parity.mjs), and a
//     closed loop is a chaotic amplifier. So a /record clip made here is not
//     comparable frame-for-frame with one made on the desk, while /measure —
//     which counts outcomes over randomised drops — is.

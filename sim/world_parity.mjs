// THE GATE THAT LICENSES /world.
//
// WHAT IS BEING CLAIMED. The live world can be given a different room — a
// flight of steps, a ball somewhere else, a prop moved — and NOTHING ELSE THIS
// BENCH ANSWERS CHANGES. Every published number in this repo came out of
// /record, /measure, /perform, /capture, /tune, /climb or /chase, and every one
// of those runs in an mjData the live lane never touches. But they all share
// one MODEL, and laying a flight means zeroing the step geoms' conaffinity in
// that shared model. If that loan ever leaked, a /climb cell scored while
// somebody was steering a duck would be scored on a different plant, silently,
// and the number would be believed.
//
// SO IT IS MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED, IN FIVE PHASES:
//
//   1. `placeSteps` lays the stairs challenge's own grid EXACTLY where
//      `layoutStairs` lays it — all twenty-eight qpos slots and all
//      twenty-eight qvel slots, `Object.is`, at full float digits, for every
//      rise in the grid. `placeSteps` is additive and `layoutStairs` is
//      untouched precisely so this comparison can exist; if the two ever
//      disagree, the world a caller describes is not the flight the audit
//      scored.
//
//   2. A four-step 60 mm flight, posted and read back, against a checked-in
//      fixture. The same bytes are the kit's `Fixtures/bench/world.json`, so
//      the Swift reader and this bench are held to one document.
//
//   3. /reset re-lays it. `mj_resetData` takes every slide back to qpos0, which
//      for the bank means the stack it boots in; a world that survived a settle
//      and not a reset would vanish at the start of the first trial. The flight
//      has to still be there, the ball has to be where the world put it and the
//      duck has to be on its feet.
//
//   4. THE ONE THAT LICENSES THE DESIGN. With that world standing, a /climb
//      cell and a /record answer byte-for-byte what they answered with no world
//      set. Then the world is read back again and must be unchanged, because
//      the climb episode parks ITS bank in ITS own mjData and must not have
//      touched this one.
//
//   5. /perform — the endpoint the paragraph above names and the one phases 1
//      to 4 never called. It can now CARRY a room of its own into the mjData
//      /record, /measure, /capture and /tune also step, so it is both the
//      biggest hole in this gate and the biggest new surface. Twelve claims,
//      5a to 5l: a request that carries no world answers exactly what it always
//      answered; a request that carries one lays it where a POST /world lays
//      it, leaf for leaf; the loan is per tick and is handed back; the module
//      global is never written; and — the thing phases 1 to 4 structurally
//      cannot see, because every call in them is awaited before the next is
//      issued — an overlapping request moves no number, PROVED to have actually
//      overlapped by a counter the bench keeps.

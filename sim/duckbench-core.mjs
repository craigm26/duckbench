// The duck bench's core: physics, the control loop, and the answers — with no
// idea what machine it is on.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. Every measurement Duck Studio shows came from a
// bench on a desk, reached over Tailscale, because an iPhone has no MuJoCo and
// no onnxruntime. That sentence is a build decision, not a law: MuJoCo compiles
// to WebAssembly and a 197,774-parameter MLP is four matrix multiplies. What
// actually stopped the phone was that the bench and Node were the same file —
// `fs.readFileSync` for the plant, `os.cpus()` for the core count,
// `onnxruntime-node` for the forward pass, `http.createServer` for the door.
// None of that is physics.
//
// So this file holds the physics and takes everything else as `env`. Node fills
// `env` with fs, os, crypto and onnxruntime; a browser fills it with fetch,
// `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`, `crypto.subtle` and a forward pass over the
// canonical parameter bytes. The plant, the control loop, the observation, the
// endpoints and every sentence they return are the same code in both, which is
// the only reason a number measured on a phone is comparable to one measured on
// the desk.
//
// IT IS A MOVE, AND IT WAS PROVED TO BE ONE. `bench_parity.mjs` replays a fixed
// script of sixty requests and compares every leaf of every answer; the split
// was accepted only when the old file and this one differed in nothing but the
// two /health fields that were deliberately added. A refactor of a file whose
// output is trajectories cannot be reviewed by reading it.
import { makeLoop } from './duckloop.mjs';
// THE ONE PIECE OF INFERENCE THE CORE OWNS, AND ONLY FOR /tune. Everything
// else asks the shell for a session, because a shell may have onnxruntime and a
// browser may not. A fold cannot be asked for that way: onnxruntime runs a
// graph and will not let you change one, so scoring a per-joint gain and trim
// means holding the parameters and multiplying them here. Both shells can reach

     * answer this bench gives carries. `track_linear_velocity`,
     * `track_angular_velocity` and `body_ang_vel` all read the trunk's TWIST;
     * `action_rate_l2` reads the NETWORK'S OWN OUTPUT. /state and /intent
     * answer with a position, a quaternion and fourteen joint angles, /record
     * adds the commands, and none of them carry a velocity or an action. A
     * client scoring a search from those would be scoring `upright` and `pose`
     * alone — and both of those are maximised by a duck that has stopped.
     * Measured on this bench at six seconds and vx 0.5: the standing policy
     * scores 2.9812 on those two where the walking policy scores 2.5287, having
     * travelled 1 mm against 1231. A search scored that way climbs by stopping.
     * The bench has the trace in front of it. Nothing else does.
     *
     * IT TAKES A RESIDUAL AND NOT A FILE. Twenty-eight numbers, against 791,584
     * bytes of base64 per candidate for a folded .onnx, and the bench already
     * holds the base network. It also keeps the fold in ONE implementation —
     * `foldParameters` is a transcription of duckkit's `DuckPolicyWriter.folding`
     * and is held to it by bytes, not by reading — so a gain that scores well
     * here behaves the same way once the app writes it into a file.
     *
     * WHICH FORWARD PASS RUNS, SAID OUT LOUD. /tune ALWAYS runs
     * `policyforward.mjs` over the canonical parameter bytes, on every shell,
     * even where the shell's own sessions are onnxruntime — because a fold is
     * arithmetic on parameters and onnxruntime has none to offer. The two agree
     * to 3.5e-6 per action (policy_parity.mjs), which is not nothing over a
     * closed loop, so a /tune number and a /record number about the same policy
     * are close relatives and not the same measurement. The alternative —
     * onnxruntime for the identity residual and this for everything else —
     * would measure a search's baseline on a different network from its
     * candidates, which is worse in the one place it would matter most.
     *
     * THE SETTLE IS THE SHELL'S, THOUGH, AND THAT IS SAID RATHER THAN HIDDEN.
     * The half second before the command starts runs the STANDING policy
     * through `rollout`, which loads it the way every other endpoint does — so
     * on the desk that settle is onnxruntime and the driven span is
     * policyforward. Within one bench that is consistent: /tune's settle is
     * bit-for-bit /record's and /perform's. Across two benches it is not, and
     * it is the reason a desk /tune and a phone /tune differ in the eighth
     * decimal of every term — measured here on 2026-09-02, `upright` 0.97838314
     * on the browser shell against 0.97838314 on the desk. A search is scored
     * against its own baseline on its own bench, so the difference does not
     * reach a verdict; a number copied from one bench to the other is a
     * different measurement.
     *
     * A TERM THIS BENCH CANNOT COMPUTE GOES IN `refused`, BY NAME. Two of the
     * six weights are negative, so a term silently left out of `terms` reads to
     * a client as the best possible value of the thing it punishes.

// WHY IT IS ITS OWN FILE AND NOT PART OF duckbench.mjs. Importing duckbench.mjs
// starts an HTTP server on a port, which makes the bench impossible to test
// without a socket and a subprocess — and the parity gate that licensed the
// split needs to call `handle` directly, in one process, with no network
// between the request and the answer. So the ENV lives here, importable, and
// duckbench.mjs is the door.
//
// EVERYTHING IN HERE IS A NODE FACT. fs for the assets, os for the core count,
// node:crypto for the digests, onnxruntime-node for the forward pass. The core
// beside it knows none of those words, which is what lets the same physics run
// in a browser on a phone.

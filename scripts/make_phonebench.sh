# exists somewhere that is its home: the core in sim/, the plant in sim/, the
# MuJoCo build in site/vendor/, the parameter bytes in sim/params/. A second
# copy checked in beside the page is a second copy that goes stale, and the one
# that goes stale silently is the plant — a probe running a different scene.mjb
# from the desk bench would print a physics-parity mismatch and be believed.
#
# IT DOES NOT TOUCH site/index.html OR ANYTHING THE WALK DEMO SERVES. The probe
# lives entirely under site/phonebench/, so deploying it cannot change the demo.
